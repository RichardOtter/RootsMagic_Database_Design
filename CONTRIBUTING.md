The goal of this GitHub repo is to make publicly accessible this collection of
reverse engineered data about the RootsMagic genealogy software database design.
Other previous collections have been very helpful toward building this collection.
(See CONTRIBUTORS.md file)
They were, however, not under version control and it was not obvious how to update them.
I hope to keep the Main branch up to date with the latest released version of RM.
A new branch will be created for the old version when a new RM version is released.

As this data collection is not aimed primarily at seasoned software developers, 
the usual GitHub mechanism of contribution by Pull Request may not be helpful- although Pull 
Requests will be be appreciated.
Update contributions will be accepted via the GitHub Issue tracker.
See-
https://github.com/ricko2001/RootsMagic_Database_Design/issues

Just include the file name that you think should be changed and the old and new text.
We  may have a short discussions about it.

Each update can be suggested by creating a new "Issue".
