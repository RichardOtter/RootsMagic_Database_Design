# RootsMagic_Database_Design

RootsMagic software, published by RootsMagic Inc. <https://RootsMagic.com>
is a genealogy research project organizational tool
used by amateur and professional genealogists and ordinary hobbyists who want to
build their family tree.

This dataset was created by the community of RootsMagic users.

RootsMagic is distinguished by its use of an unencrypted SQLite database as its
storage file format. That makes the user's data available to third party tools
and applications. One won't have to worry about one's data being locked up in 
a proprietary storage format.

If you are interested in SQL access to the RootsMagic database, you must become
familiar with the web site <https://SQLiteToolsForRootsMagic.com>

There is a user forum where interesting questions are posed and answered.

The forum format allows a easy exchange of ideas and posting of SQL statements, but it
does not lend itself towards creating documentation and keeping it current and fixing errors.
That's why I am starting this project where anyone can contribute, fix errors, and fill in the gaps.
Everything is under version control, so we can keep current docs for all future RM releases
 in separate branches.
