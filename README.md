# RootsMagic_Database_Design

RootsMagic software, published by RootsMagic Inc. <https://RootsMagic.com>
is a genealogy research project organizational tool
used by amateur and professional genealogists and ordinary hobbyists who want to
build their family tree.

This dataset was created by the community of RootsMagic users.

RootsMagic is distinguished by its use of an unencrypted SQLite database as its
storage file format. That makes the user's data available to third party tools
and applications. One won't have to worry about one's data being locked up in 
a proprietary storage format.
