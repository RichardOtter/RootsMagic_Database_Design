# PersonTable

## Purpose

Stores records each of which represent a single person. Can be considered the most fundamental table

## Table DDL

``` SQL
CREATE TABLE PersonTable (PersonID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, UniqueID TEXT, Sex INTEGER, ParentID INTEGER, SpouseID INTEGER, Color INTEGER, Color1 INTEGER, Color2 INTEGER, Color3 INTEGER, Color4 INTEGER, Color5 INTEGER, Color6 INTEGER, Color7 INTEGER, Color8 INTEGER, Color9 INTEGER, Relate1 INTEGER, Relate2 INTEGER, Flags INTEGER, Living INTEGER, IsPrivate INTEGER, Proof INTEGER, Bookmark INTEGER, Note TEXT, UTCModDate FLOAT );
```

No indexes created for this table.

UniqueID  looks like a GUID. Not clear how they are generated. TODO


Both ParentID and  SpouseID are _FK =>FamilyTable.FamilyID 
These point to a parent family and spouse family.\
Probably these are the relationships used in reports and display as default.\
Just changing the display to show another spouse will presumably update SpouseID.\

Bookmark  _GUI-LAB name is in Bookmark tab

Color columns\ 
Each column, "" to 9 represents one of the 10 possible color "sets"\
The column contains the color of the person when the corresponding color set is active.
Where are color number definitions stored? in ConfigTable?  TODO


TODO
Relate1 1 -> 12 & 999 (7 o these)
Relate2 2 -> 12


Flags

From FaceBook group-
In the underlying PersonsTable there are flags for spouses of both blood relatives and spouses of blood relatives: 1 = "Half"
2 = "Spouse of" male blood relation (ie display uses "Father, Uncle, Cousin")
3 = "Spouse of half" male blood relation (ie display uses "Father, Uncle, Cousin")
6 = "Spouse of" female blood relation (ie display uses "Mother, Aunt, Cousin")
7 = "Spouse of half" female blood relation (ie display uses "Mother, Aunt, Cousin")
10 = "Spouse of" blood relation where sex is unknown (ie display uses "Mother/Father, Aunt/Uncle, Cousin")



Each name has a proof
Do all items in edit screen have proof fields?

## Open Questions

UniqueID appears to be a GUID varient. Haven't seen documentation. Not tested:\
What algorithm is used to create them.\
When one is assigned, how they differ between database.

Date Edited in RM GUI\
Is it simply the UTCModDate of the PersonTable row?

or does it depend on other rows pointing to thie person?
Do all fields in PersonTable cause UTCModDate to update?
